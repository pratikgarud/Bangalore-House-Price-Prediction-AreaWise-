Property Technology is the next big thing that is going to disrupt the real estate market. Nowadays, we see applications of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in almost all the domains but for a long time the real estate industry was quite slow in adopting data science and machine learning for problem solving and improving their processes.  However, things are changing quite fast as we see a lot of adoption of AI and ML in the US and European real estate markets. But the Indian real estate market has to catch-up a lot. This model proposes a machine learning approach for solving the house price prediction problem in the classified advertisements. So we apply machine learning algorithms like LinearRegression,K-means clustering etc to find out groups and accuracy.
